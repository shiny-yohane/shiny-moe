The day has finally come, the new much anticipated co-production between Trigger and A-1 Pictures if finally here. Will it be any good? It's too soon to say. For the time being let's review the first episode.
# Episode title

The episode open up with a mysterious red-skinned girl telling about the story of the Jian, a legendary bird who cannot fly if not paired with a companion. She have an ankle bracelet with a bar code. Is she some sort of specimen escaped from a laboratory or something? She's wounded.

After a couple of scenes we get introduced to 016 (also known as Hiro). He's the male protagonist. A boy who failed the test to become a Franxx pilot. A Franxx is reveleaded to be a giant robot who need to be piloted by a pair of boy and girl. Hiro and his partner [insert partner name here] failed the test and now they have to go back to their orphanage. Except that Hiro is misteriously granted the privilage to stay in the Plantation even if he can't ride the Franxx.
