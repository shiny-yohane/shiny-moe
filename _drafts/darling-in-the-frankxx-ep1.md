The day has finally come, the new much anticipated co-production between Trigger and A-1 Pictures if finally here. Will it be any good? It's too soon to say. For the time being let's review the first episode.
## Episode title

### Summary
The episode open up with a mysterious red-skinned girl (which I guess is Zero Two) telling about the story of the Jian, a legendary bird who cannot fly if not paired with a companion. She have an ankle bracelet with a bar code. Is she some sort of specimen escaped from a laboratory or something? She's wounded.

After a couple of scenes we get introduced to 016 (also known as Hiro). He's the male protagonist. A boy who failed the test to become a Franxx pilot. A Franxx is revealed to be a giant robot who need to be piloted by a pair of boy and girl. Hiro and his partner [insert partner name here] failed the test and now they have to go back to their orphanage. Except that Hiro is mysteriously granted the privilege to stay in the Plantation even if he can't ride the Franxx.

Rumors about Zero Two spread fast around the Plantation. According to the rumors every partner she ever had died after that third time piloting the Franxx with her.

Also there is girl called 015 (Ichigo) who seems to be the classic tsundere girl who love the protagonist just because. We'll see about that.

Hero and Zero Two finally met. The young boy is immediately captivated by Zero Two. They have a brief exchange where they explain each other life philosophies (Hiro is afraid, Zero Two is eager). Zero Two immediately take a liking in Hero.

While the other Plantation kids where having their graduation ceremony. Hero and [insert partner name here] are waiting to board their transportation to the old orphanage. [insert partner name here] tricks Hiro to stay and immediately after a huge robot dinosaur emerge from the sand and start attacking the Plantation. Apparently the beast is a [Caccosaur].

Zero Two and her partner are trying to fight the [Caccosaur] when he throw the Strelitzia (Zero Two's Franxx) crashing into the Plantation. Zero Two's partner is done for. She quickly ask Hiro if he want to pilot the Strelitzia with here. Hiro is reluctant but she kisses him and the Franxx immediately powers up. They kill the [Caccosaur] who explodes in a blue cloud dropping some items. 

At the end Hiro is confused but happy because he managed to ride a Franxx.

### Notes

- Female Franxx pilots are also called .
- Who are APE?
- What are the [Caccosaur]?
- Who created the [Caccosaur]?
- Why the [Caccosaur] attack mankind?
- Is revealed that Zero Two has [Caccosaur] blood.

### Open Questions
- Who are APE?
- What are the [Caccosaur]?
- Who created the [Caccosaur]?
- Why the [Caccosaur] attack mankind?
- Why does Zero Two have [Caccosaur] blood? Is she some kind of experiment?

### Closing Thoughts
I liked this first episode even if had way more clicke in it (Whiny male protag with apparently hidden powers, misterious beautiful female who is instanlyy interestend in the protag and she helps him find his true strengths).

Also I'm not really fond of the Franxx design. They look like a weird crossover between Megaman Battle Network and Phantasy Star Only. Expecially when they opened theyr eyes.

I know this is a 24 episode series so it's probably gonna have a few introduction episodes but I hope they are not some episodic school themed slice of life.
